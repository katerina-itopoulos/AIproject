# AIproject
Image Generation for a Fantasy-themed Card Game Deck POC using local models.

The notebook AI project(1) can be downloaded from the repository and used for other implementations.

The notebook contains the code to install and import libraries necessary to run the code, however other installations such as Python may need to be installed if not available on the run time you use. 

The experiment was done using Google Colaboratory amd the A100 GPU runtime available to download the diffusion models and run the inference tasks efficiently, however if you have access to other GPU sources this may also be used for the implementation.

The google drive folders used to store the output images from each model should be set to the paths of your desired folders or the code will create the folders for you in your drive as done in the experiment.

The Human evaluation results were done manually for the experiment so need to be recalculated for new implementations.
